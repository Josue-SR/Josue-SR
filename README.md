### ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Welcome to my GitHub Profile
My name is Josue, if you're really interested in the pronounciation here's a video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMRktH6ymSQ. I am currently a junior attending CSU Monterey Bay. I am 20 years old and I've been programming constantly for around 4 years now.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and Python
- ðŸ“Œ My goal for this year is to get an Internship for 2023
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started programming because I was introduced to technology at a young age and I wanted to create apps that anyone can use.
