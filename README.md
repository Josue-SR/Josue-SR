### ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Welcome to my GitHub Profile
My name is Josue, if you're really interested in the pronounciation here's a video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMRktH6ymSQ. I am currently a sophomore attending CSU Monterey Bay. I am 19 years old and I've been programming constantly for around 2 years now. I am still a bit new to programming but I got into it because of the feeling of solving a problem and creating something you can show to your friends. I am majoring in Computer Science and I am going to become a software engineer. 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my personal website https://josuesantos.me
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and Python
- ðŸ“Œ My goal for this year is to get an Internship
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started programming because I was interested in Minecraft Plugins
