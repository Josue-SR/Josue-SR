### 👋 Hey, Welcome to my GitHub Profile
My name is Josue, if you're really interested in the pronounciation here's a video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMRktH6ymSQ. I am currently a Senior attending CSU Monterey Bay. I am 21 years old and I've been programming consistently for around 5 years now.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Docker and React.
- ☀️ I am very interested in front-end development and try to boost my skills on the back-end part.
- 📌 My goal for this year is to get a Job after graduation.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started programming because I was introduced to technology at a young age and I wanted to create apps that anyone can use.
    It's also the best way for me to express my creativity.
